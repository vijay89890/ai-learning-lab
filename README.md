📘 AI Learning Lab

Welcome to my AI Learning Lab 🚀 — a personal journey into learning and building hands-on projects with Prompt Engineering, Reasoning Methods, and Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG).
This repo tracks my progress, experiments, and showcases practical notebooks.

🚀 Learning Progress

✅ Day 1: Prompt Engineering Basics (zero-shot vs. few-shot)

✅ Day 2: Chain-of-Thought & Tree-of-Thought reasoning methods

✅ Day 3: RAG Fundamentals (embeddings, vector stores, retrieval)

🔄 Next: Build more advanced RAG-powered applications

🛠️ Tech Stack

Python 🐍

LangChain for RAG + chaining

FAISS / Chroma for vector databases

Jupyter Notebooks for experiments

🧪 How to Run

Clone this repo:

git clone https://github.com/vijay89890/ai-learning-lab.git
cd ai-learning-lab


Create a virtual environment:

python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate   # (Linux/Mac)
venv\Scripts\activate      # (Windows)


Install dependencies:

pip install -r requirements.txt


Open Jupyter:

jupyter notebook

📌 Roadmap

Check my detailed ROADMAP.md
 to see what I’m learning next!
Spoiler: More on autonomous AI agents, n8n workflows, and advanced RAG demos.

🌟 Goals

Showcase hands-on AI learning publicly

Build mini-projects in notebooks for each concept

Transition from theory → practice → projects
